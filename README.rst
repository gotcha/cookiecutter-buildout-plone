cookiecutter-buildout-plone
===========================

This is a `cookiecutter` template that produces a development buildout ready to run Plone.

Run `cookiecutter gh:gotcha/cookiecutter-buildout-plone` to produce a directory
`buildout-name`.

Then `cd` in that newly created directory.

And run `make fg` to run Plone.

You can access the Plone server via `http://localhost:8080` with the user
`admin` and password `admin`. (This is obviously not meant to be used on any
production server.)
